Welcome to Python 3.10's help utility!

If this is your first time using Python, you should definitely check out
the tutorial on the internet at https://docs.python.org/3.10/tutorial/.

Enter the name of any module, keyword, or topic to get help on writing
Python programs and using Python modules.  To quit this help utility and
return to the interpreter, just type "quit".

To get a list of available modules, keywords, symbols, or topics, type
"modules", "keywords", "symbols", or "topics".  Each module also comes
with a one-line summary of what it does; to list the modules whose name
or summary contain a given string such as "spam", type "modules spam".

Mutable Sequence Types
**********************

The operations in the following table are defined on mutable sequence
types. The "collections.abc.MutableSequence" ABC is provided to make
it easier to correctly implement these operations on custom sequence
types.

In the table *s* is an instance of a mutable sequence type, *t* is any
iterable object and *x* is an arbitrary object that meets any type and
value restrictions imposed by *s* (for example, "bytearray" only
accepts integers that meet the value restriction "0 <= x <= 255").

+--------------------------------+----------------------------------+-----------------------+

Notes:

1. *t* must have the same length as the slice it is replacing.

2. The optional argument *i* defaults to "-1", so that by default the
   last item is removed and returned.

3. "remove()" raises "ValueError" when *x* is not found in *s*.

4. The "reverse()" method modifies the sequence in place for economy
   of space when reversing a large sequence.  To remind users that it
   operates by side effect, it does not return the reversed sequence.

5. "clear()" and "copy()" are included for consistency with the
   interfaces of mutable containers that donâ€™t support slicing
   operations (such as "dict" and "set"). "copy()" is not part of the
   "collections.abc.MutableSequence" ABC, but most concrete mutable
   sequence classes provide it.

   New in version 3.3: "clear()" and "copy()" methods.

6. The value *n* is an integer, or an object implementing
   "__index__()".  Zero and negative values of *n* clear the sequence.
   Items in the sequence are not copied; they are referenced multiple
   times, as explained for "s * n" under Common Sequence Operations.

help> quit

You are now leaving help and returning to the Python interpreter.
If you want to ask for help on a particular object directly from the
interpreter, you can type "help(object)".  Executing "help('string')"
has the same effect as typing a particular string at the help> prompt.
help('ASSERTION')
The "assert" statement
**********************

Assert statements are a convenient way to insert debugging assertions
into a program:

   assert_stmt ::= "assert" expression ["," expression]

The simple form, "assert expression", is equivalent to

   if __debug__:
       if not expression: raise AssertionError

The extended form, "assert expression1, expression2", is equivalent to

   if __debug__:
       if not expression1: raise AssertionError(expression2)

These equivalences assume that "__debug__" and "AssertionError" refer
to the built-in variables with those names.  In the current
implementation, the built-in variable "__debug__" is "True" under
normal circumstances, "False" when optimization is requested (command
line option "-O").  The current code generator emits no code for an
assert statement when optimization is requested at compile time.  Note
that it is unnecessary to include the source code for the expression
that failed in the error message; it will be displayed as part of the
stack trace.

Assignments to "__debug__" are illegal.  The value for the built-in
variable is determined when the interpreter starts.
